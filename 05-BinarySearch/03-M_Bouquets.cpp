/*
ðŸ’¡ Problem Understanding:

we're given:
- `bloomDay[]`: An array where `bloomDay[i]` is the day the i-th flower will bloom.
- `m`: Number of bouquets we want to make.
- `k`: Number of **adjacent** flowers needed to make one bouquet.

â›” Constraint:
- we can only use flowers that have bloomed.
- Each bouquet must have `k` consecutive bloomed flowers.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective:
Find the **minimum day** such that it is possible to make **at least `m` bouquets**.
If not possible, return -1.

ðŸ§  Idea:
- Use **binary search** to find the earliest day on which we can form all required bouquets.
- The helper function will check if it's possible to make `m` bouquets by a specific day.
